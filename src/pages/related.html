# About & Thoughts

## Potential changes to the system

### Should this system be namespaced?

While it's largely backwards compatible with existing YDS, we could add a "B-" or something in front of the ratings to help indicate it's using a new system like how the SPS SR system  uses an "S-". Something like B-2.5 R.

### Show PG by default for Class 2-3?

This would help differentiate it from traditional YDS if not namespaced - if you see a 2 PG you can expect it not include 2.5 terrain.

### Have spaces between modifiers?

If we include PG for Class 2-3 terrain then terrain and risk should be broken up. I like the brevity of keeping them combined and there's only a handful of regular combinations: S, C, R, X, SR, and SX would be all the reasonable results (and CR and CX still fit in nicely). Class 4 terarin generally won't be sliding or collapsing, SPG and CPG feel more confusing.

## Alternative Established System?

The Sierra Club SPS has come up with a [Ratings for Scramblers](https://www.sierraclub.org/angeles/sierra-peaks/ratings-for-scramblers) that tries to solve some of the ambiguity in the lower classes (their 2.2 is similar to my 2.5.). 

### My Critiques of the Mountain Scrambler Ratings System

It's well thought out and more informative than traditional YDS, but IMO makes the same mistake of YDS of combining exposure with terrain aspects and modes of travel into a single rating.

I've been on terrain that would be 2.0 according to their rating in terms of difficulty but had fatal exposure - is that a 2.2 due to exposure, even if it's a straightforward 2.0 slab walk? You can try and parse down "risk" as being tied to a fall being less likely on easier terrain, but I think just listing exposure is simpler and fits how people think of terrain better. 

Tying routefinding into ratings makes some intuitive sense, and works in most cases, but there are spots that can be more technical but obvious in terms of route finding, or passes where a lot of people end up on Class 4 instead of 2 due to a poor choice 2/3 of the way down (looking at you Cirque).

One thing I like about my system is that it makes it clear when class 2 is less desirable than class 3 - I haven't done King Col but despite it being Class 2 it has loose fatally exposed terrain. Something like Valor pass which is a bunch of slabs with a super simple fat crack of short class 3 sounds infinitely more welcoming.

Having King Col at 2.2 and Valor 3.0 in their system makes sense in terms of difficulty, but that puts the risk of injury at the same level on both... which isn't true at all! Comparing 2 SX and 3 makes it lot clearer. It's not unusual for me to choose to do some stable 3 over loose 2 when I get the chance. Desirability of terrain isn't linear according to difficulty of movement.

The breakdown into 0.1 and 0.2 systems is very thoughtful, but also feels like it can get into trouble - I don't carry a theodolite with me when I'm backpacking and route finding can change the maximum angle of things. Just stating the general type of movement over terrain (1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4) makes sense combined with standout aspects of terrain (S/C & PG/R/X) to me as people can look at modern maps with slope angle shading and get a feel for the steepness of a pass. It's also less subjective than what people "feel" a section is in terms of simplicity of holds etc.

The fact that length of the approach is factored into the rating feels a bit wrong to me as well, that should be apparent just by reading topo especially now with slope shading overlays on major mapping clients. Pilot Knob is similar to Observation Peak (and definitely requires a bit more technique and is more exposed than Midway) but it's rated as 2.1 and the other two are 2.2.

## Traditional YDS

According to Secor (he goes into more detail, this is his initial brief introduction, it's well worth owning your own copy, the third edition is the latest):

Class 1 is walking.

Class 2 is defined here as difficult cross-country travel. In the High Sierra this is usually talus hopping, which requires the occasional use of hands for balance.

Class 3 is where the climbing begins. Hands and feet are used not just for balance, but to hang onto the rock. Steep or large talus can be rated as class 3.

Class 4 is on steep rock, with smaller holds, and a lot of exposure.

Class 5 is steep and difficult rock climbing, involving the use of protection placed between the leader and the belayer. I differentiate class 4 from class 5 by the hand- and footholds. Class 5 requires obscure holds [...]

Another way of differentiating between classes (which is intuitive if overly simple and lacking in nuance) is the points of contact system, counting rope as a point of contact (I didn't come up with it and don't think it's better than Secor, but it's simple).

C1 = feet

C2 = feet + 1 hand [or trekking poles extended/contracted, used on steep or loose terrain]

C3 = feet + 2 hands

C4 = feet + 2 hands + rope (recommended)

C5 = feet + 2 hands + rope + elaborate means of protection

For more Class 5 centric reading there's great long form articles on [Climbing House](https://climbinghouse.com/grades-charts/) and [REI](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/climbing-bouldering-rating.html).

## Origin & Feedback

Starting from [this post on High Sierra Topix](https://www.highsierratopix.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=22124&start=30#p171019) there's been some good conversation on the evolution of this system.

I'll be starting a new thread on HST when this site is a little more functional - if you're proficient with git and markdown feel free to make a pull request, or just put comments into the issues section of [the Github repo](https://github.com/erutan/backpacker-yds).
