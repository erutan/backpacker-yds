# Examples & Usage

## Order of Operations

Class (1-5), then Terrain Aspects (S, L, C, or B), and finally Risk (R or X).

Terrain that you slide around on and is exposed on uneven/steep ground would always be 2 S R, not 2 R S or R2S etc.

## Some Example Pass Ratings

King Col: Class 2 S X.

This pass should not be taken due to uncomfortably slippery terrain over fatal exposure.

The technique required is to move over steep and/or unstable ground using hands (or poles!) for balance. That's Class 2. The fact that if you slip you die or get medivaced out instead of just falling on your ass is because it's fatally exposed. The fact that your feet will slide when you step above that fatal exposure makes it sliding. This is why people say King Col feels like Class 4 - the proximity to the drop makes it 'feel' like you're on a more technical climbing mode of travel because near vertical terrain has a lot more high cliffs than terrain 5-30 degrees in slope. 2 SX 'feels' like 4 because it's exposed, not because you need to have good shoes and know how to move on rock with small holds that require some climbing techniques. 

Cirque: Class 2.5

North side: Straightforward class 2 with some 2.5 near the top. South side: 2.5 ledges near the top with routefinding (or more directly short class 3) on the south side followed by significant routefinding that can mean the difference between straightforward class 2 & 2.5 and wet class 4 near the bottom.

Rodgers: Class 2 C

The upper west side of the pass is composed of talus that require significant routefinding and situational awareness to stay safe on - landslides can occur 30 feet upslope of where a step is taken and sweep down onto the hiker.

Valor: Class 3. 

Straightforward mix of slab, broken slab, and very occasional talus with brief Class 2.5 and Class 3 sections to gain/drop from the ridge from the east.

Vernon: Class 2 S, Class 2 R, 2.5.

East: Straightforward mixed 2 until the last two hundred feet which are a mix of occasionally somewhat wobbly talus and optional stable 2.5/3 sections to an exposed feeling wide talus ledge then some routefinding for a 2.5 path through 4. West: Mix of generally stable talus and rolling slab, and varying amounts of 2S depending on routefinding.

Note: the sliding and exposed sections for this are in different sections, so it's not really 2 SR but 2S & 2R. Kind of awkward. 

Lamarck Col: Class 2.5 

East: Well worn use trail until the base of the col, which generally holds snow (or ice) mixed with stable talus year round. West: Straightforward Class 2 mix of stable talus and a sandy slope, with almost certainly some 2.5 moments near the top. Worth noting that the large talus along Darwin lakes 2 & 3 is more of an obstacle than the pass itself!

North Col: Class 2.5/3.

Class 2 from the east with either 2.5 or straightforward 3 at the top depending on time and effort spent on routefinding. West side is 1/2.

Dragon: Class 2 L, 2.5.

Ursula: Class 2 X, 3 R.
