# Updated YDS Proposal

## Overview (what and why)

The Yosemite Decimal System has been in use for decades and is the default way of rating mountainous terrain. It was created and used by technically skilled mountaineers, and since then most of the attention was spent on the top of the scale (Class 5) leaving gaps in describing Class 2 and 3 terrain that are significant for backpackers. This is a proposal for a more inclusive system which builds on it's historical roots while being useful for a wider range of individuals.

The largest change is the addition of a “Class 2.5” which clarifies an ambiguous grey area between Class 2 and 3. Existing 2.5 terrain would most likely be rated Class 2 by climbers or mountaineers who didn't consider it “easy climbing”, and Class 3 by backpackers who weren't expecting to have to use both hands to pull or drop themselves and their heavy packs down what was promised to just be uneven ground.

The second change is the addition of two sets of modifiers for terrain aspects (Sliding and Collapsing) and exposure (PG, R, and X). One can easily come up dozens of useful ways to describe terrain - this an an attempt to include only the most pressing aspects. Further research of routes is heavily encouraged. The main advantage of this system isn't having a rating that perfectly describes reality (it doesn't), but creating a clearly defined shared vocabulary so descriptions of terrain are (not as) subjective and can be more universally understood in comparison to each other.

Similar to how Class 5 is ordered by the class rating, grade, and risk (e.g. 5.10c III PG), classes 2 through 4 will be class, terrain aspects, and then risk (e.g. 2 SR).

## Classes (modes of travel)

Classes are used to break down the 'mode of travel' over terrain and the general level of technique required and do not always directly map to difficulty, safety, or how preferable a route  is. They are meant to be a basic check on your perceived limits and technical comfort level as well as to set expectations for what is considered "on route".

### Class 1: Walking

You're on relatively even ground which is flat or on a low to moderate angle. Occasional knee high obstacles may exist (roots, rocks, etc) and the grade generally won't be above that of a maintained trail (around 20 degrees of slope). If you need to heelbrake, crabwalk, sidestep or use other advanced forms of "walking" that one wouldn't use on an idealized dirt trail - it isn't walking.

Occasionally one side of a pass or slope of a peak is actually all Class 1, but generally speaking it's used when are large sections of Class 1 that still contain some Class 2 terrain (the band between 13,200 and 13,400 feet on the south slopes of Langley) - this is generally written as 1/2 to show it's on the simpler side of things while not being a cakewalk.

### Class 2: Uneven and/or steep ground requiring occasional use of hands or trekking poles for balance

All talus falls into (at least) this category, as well as steep enough slopes of any surface. If the talus isn't so large you need to climb over it, but you need to put a hand on a piece here or there to support yourself it's class 2. While experienced people can jog over stable small to medium sized talus it's still uneven ground that requires a different mindset and skillset than walking on more even low angled ground. If you need to "read" the ridges in a slab to safely ascend or descend it, if scree is sliding out under your boot, if you're sliding down duff due to slope angle, or you need to dig in with poles not to slip due to loose terrain it would fall into Class 2. There's no "hard" slope angle where it starts, but if you're getting near a 30 degree slope it's generally not Class 1 anymore.

  <p>Backpacker Note: Carrying a heavy and/or unbalanced pack can greatly impact traversal on Class 2 terrain. Packs that are suspended off of your back are nice on trail, but shift your center of gravity more than sweat inducing ones directly on your back. While packs are generally expected to be carried through Class 2 terrain, there can be spots where one needs to squeeze through large blocks of talus or under a chockstone or fallen tree where they'd be taken off and passed through. There's a LOT of variety in Class 2 terrain, if you're new to moving over Class 2 it's highly recommended to do further research on your route and passes on it vs just relying on a rating system which is a useful as a shorthand to experienced mountain folk.</p>
</div>

### Class 2.5: Short mantles/drops and/or scrambling

You are using your hands to pull yourself up some terrain, but you're not quite "climbing". Obstacles thigh high to chest high that can't be stepped over, but you can get a leg over in one or two moves fall into this category. Moving on terrain where your feet are on the ground, but where you are holding onto the sides of a chute or pieces of talus to help pull yourself up but are still walking up it would fall into this category. You generally don't have both feet off the ground for more than a few seconds, if at all.

Having to butt scoot down something, mantle onto a rock, awkwardly flop a knee or leg on top of something and pull yourself up, etc falls into 2.5 (it is the least photogenic class to ascend or descend). Clambering onto and then off deadfall would be non-rock 2.5. People extremely sensitive to exposure may find 2.5 uncomfortable.

<div class="callout alert">
  <p>Backpacker Note: Travel with a full pack may be awkward or uncomfortable, but generally won't cause someone turn back due to terrain as it is usually possible to lift your pack over the obstacle and go up unencumbered (assuming aqequate upper body strength, etc). While even novices are very unlikely to want to be roped in, carrying a length of ~10ft static rope can be useful for lowering your pack down 2.5 terrain so you can drop unencumbered.</p>
</div>

### Class 3: Simple Climbing

You are using both hands to hang and hold onto the rock and climb up with your feet needing to find footholds to continue ascending. Novices may feel uncomfortable, but the holds are large and easy to locate. Class 3 is generally at least head height to a few body lengths going up passes, and is usually used to gain a new Class 2 ledge after one runs out or to gain the ridge itself. Your feet may be off the ground and supporting your weight as you climb for extended periods of time, and for those sensitive to heights there is mostly likely awareness of a fall. Class 3 is possible on flat slopes given large (appliance to room sized) talus on it that one would have to climb around on. Going though the middle of the slide in Slide Canyon is Class 3. 

<div class="callout alert">
  <p>Backpacker Note: It's “simple” climbing, but carrying a fully loaded pack up Class 3 can be VERY different from doing it unladen. The extra weight makes vertical moves more difficult - more critically your center of balance may be further away from the rock pulling you away from it and pack itself can become a physical obstacle if going up a crack or relatively tight space.  If using trekking poles, they'd generally be tucked away. It's not fun having one get stuck in a 15 foot crack halfway up it and having to downclimb and try and work it out while hanging onto rock.</p>

  <p>If you aren't experienced carrying a loaded pack up Class 3, it's highly recommended to travel with someone more experienced who can shuttle your pack up, explain and demonstrate the route, and if necessary wait at the top to grasp your wrist or stay at the bottom to spot you and or push your feet onto holds and call out moves. Trip leaders - it's on you to make sure novices make it safely up Class 3 with minimal risk and psychological damage.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout alert">
  <p>Climber Note: There is no limit to the height of such terrain, and risk can be involved - if novices are along it can be a good idea to provide a rope and requisite gear to belay them if they feel uncomfortable.</p>
</div>

Secor's favorite description was given by Steve Roper: “Imagine climbing a steep, narrow staircase outside of a tall building without benefit of a railing: scary but easy.”

### Class 4: Climbing (rope recommended)

A noticeable step up from class 3 in terms of technique required. Class 4 is on vertical or near vertical rock, with smaller holds and is likely exposed. A classic example of unexposed Class 4 would be the wet steep walls that people downclimb on the southern side of Cirque Pass if they don't stay east of the pond below. Class 4 generally should not be done with a full pack for any considerable length, and many boots and shoes will start to fail on the more subtle terrain. You'll generally want either more traditional boots with "structure" to the toe box or a lightweight shoe that forms to the foot for better groundfeel and independent use of foot muscles for control. Footwear with floppy toe boxes that are comfortable on trail will likely slip off smaller holds. Rope is advised to be be in use though experienced individuals will go without at their own risk.

Exposure risks aside, fit individuals with no climbing experience that have a good sense of balance, proper footwear, and no heavy packs can generally make their way intuitively up Class 4 terrain. Expect overlap in the lower numbers of Class 5 (up to around 5.5) and what's considered Class 4. If you're really interested in geeking out on technical details, this is [an epic rant on Class 4](https://www.summitpost.org/class-four-is-a-myth-problems-in-yds/891794).

### Class 5: Technical Climbing (rope expected)

Class 5 been modified throughout the years as a living document so has been kept more up to date. What most people visualize as Class 5 realistically starts around 5.5 or 5.6.

<div class="callout alert">
  <p>Backpacker note: Having some basic skill in Class 5 makes Class 2.5 and 3 much more manageable (you'll have some techniques and mental models for how to move that translate over) - it could be worth signing up for an introductory course at a local climbing gym if one is available.</p>

## Class 1-3 Terrain Modifiers

Terrain Modifiers - these are used to point out consequential aspects of the terrain itself (as opposed to how you would move over it) that it could pose enough risk or discomfort to cause someone to turn around that would otherwise be comfortable moving on the class of terrain they are otherwise on. Occasionally wobbly talus or dirt that moves around a little bit is considered within the normal bounds of "stable" terrain. If there isn't a S or C it doesn't mean that everything is perfectly stable but it should be passable under normal conditions.

### S - Sliding

This is talus which shifts, or ground which either moves when stepped on or on which feet slide when stepping onto. Movement should self-brake within a foot or so and will not cause a major landslide, but this definitely impacts traction. Probably the least popular form is this terrain is sand or pebbles on top of otherwise hard packed dirt or rock, which is often explained as walking on ball bearings. Not seriously dangerous in and of itself, but can be very unnerving and uncomfortable to move on. Sliding terrain which is also exposed should be avoided if possible.

### C - Collapsing

Talus, scree, or gravel that will go into a lengthy landslide that can either crash into or bury someone (Rodger & Clinch Passes) or gravel that contains loosely held talus in it that can be dislodged onto people (Junction Pass). Note that terrain which is generally stable can be fatal when saturated with early season snow melt, or during or immediately after after a major rainstorm leading to mudslides or loosening large talus which would normally be stable - this isn't covered here but is something to be aware of.

### B - Bushbashing 

Bushes are at least waist high and there are no paths between them for at least 20 feet. Occasional bushes one has to brush by here or there, or that have followable sandy paths between them with a couple of feet of pushing through here and there don't fall under this rating.

## Class 1-4 Exposure Modifiers

Following the spirit of the Class 5 movie rating risk modifiers, but not concerned with aid placement obviously. 

### PG - Somewhat Risky

There's no high drops or high risk of serious injury or death, but you could get banged up if you fall a short distance or lose your balance. This happens enough (and purely G terrain is rare enough on a pass or peak) that this should be considered a default state and be left out for brevity. 

The exception to PG being a default assumption is for very short stretches of Class 4, which is traditionally expected to be long and exposed but can still pose a significant obstacle to someone with a large pack on. Labeling these sections "4 PG" indicates a more advanced mode of travel even if there isn't a significant risk due to exposure.

### R - Exposed

While one would likely be able to walk away from an accident on this terrain it could result in moderate to serious injuries as it is significantly more exposed than average terrain of the class. People not overly sensitive to exposure may feel uncomfortable or unwilling to continue. This will likely be the most disputed modifier. :)

### X - Fatally Exposed

Sections with enough of an immediate drop that either a mistake in movement or a failure in terrain would most likely result in death or injury requiring evacuation. This can be “indirect” in the sense that there's a short distance to bounce or slide down before the drop - your toes don't have to be hanging over into the void for something to be exposed. Large deep gaps between talus that one could fall into and be unable to reasonably exit that cannot be safely bypassed would fall into this level of exposure (North Dragon Pass).
