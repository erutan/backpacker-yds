# Updated YDS Proposal

You can read more about the what and why on the [related thoughts](related.html) page. Major issues that are under consideration are listed in [this github repo](https://github.com/erutan/backpacker-yds/issues), feel free to commment or add a new one!

## Classes (modes of travel)

Classes are used to break down the 'mode of travel' over terrain and the general level of technique required and, as they are abstractions, do not always directly map to difficulty or how preferable a route  is. They are meant to be a basic check on your limits and comfort level as well as to set expectations for what is considered "on route".

### Class 1: Walking

You're on relatively even ground which is flat or on a low to moderate angle. Occasional knee high obstacles may exist (roots, rocks, etc) and the grade generally won't be above that of a maintained trail (around 20 degrees of slope). If you need to heelbrake, crabwalk, sidestep or use other advanced forms of "walking" that one wouldn't use on an idealized dirt trail - it isn't walking. Complex routefinding isn't necessary to have a safe and enjoyable experience.

Occasionally one side of a pass or slope of a peak is actually all Class 1, but generally speaking it's used when are large sections of Class 1 that still contain some Class 2 terrain (the band between 13,200 and 13,400 feet on the south slopes of Langley). Terrain like this should be written as 1/2 to show it's mostly walking so it's simpler than something mostly Class 2, but it has some brief sections that require more care and attention.

### Class 2: Uneven and/or steep ground (requiring occasional use of hands or trekking poles for balance)

All talus falls into (at least) this category, as well as steep enough slopes of any surface. If the talus isn't so large you need to climb over it, but you need to put a hand on a piece here or there to support yourself it's class 2. While experienced people can jog over stable small to medium sized talus it's still uneven ground that requires a different mindset and skillset than walking on more even low angled ground. If you need to "read" the ridges in a slab to safely ascend or descend it, if scree is sliding out under your boot, if you're sliding down duff due to slope angle, or you need to dig in with poles not to slip due to loose terrain it would fall into Class 2. There's no hard numerical slope angle where Class 1 ends and Class 2 starts, but once you get around to a 25 to 30 degree slope it's probably not Class 1 anymore.

  <p>Backpacker Note: Carrying a heavy and/or unbalanced pack can greatly impact traversal on Class 2 terrain. Packs that are suspended off of your back are nice on trail, but shift your center of gravity more than sweat inducing ones directly on your back. While packs are generally expected to be carried through Class 2 terrain, there can be spots where one needs to squeeze through large blocks of talus or under a chockstone or fallen tree where they'd be taken off and passed through. There's a LOT of variety in Class 2 terrain, if you're new to moving over Class 2 it's highly recommended to do further research on your route and passes on it! Rating systems are useful as a shorthand but capture every aspect of Terrain.</p>
</div>

### Class 2.5: Short mantles/drops or scrambling

You are using your hands to pull yourself up some terrain, but you're not quite "climbing". Obstacles thigh high to head high that can't be stepped over, but you can get a leg over by your third move (and most often sooner) fall into this category. Moving on terrain where your feet are on the ground, but where you are holding onto the sides of a chute or pieces of talus to help pull yourself up so are still essentially walking up vs climbing also fall into this category. You never have both feet off the ground for more than a few seconds.

Having to butt scoot down something, mantle onto a rock, awkwardly flop a knee or leg on top of something and pull yourself up, etc falls into 2.5 (it is the least photogenic class to ascend or descend!). Clambering onto and then off deadfall would be a non-rock example of 2.5. People very sensitive to exposure may find it discomforting.

<div class="callout alert">
  <p>Backpacker Note: Travel with a full pack may be awkward or uncomfortable, but Class 2.5 generally won't cause someone turn back due to terrain. It is usually possible to lift your pack over the obstacle and go up unencumbered. While even novices are very unlikely to want to be roped in, carrying a length of ~10ft static rope can be useful for lowering your pack down 2.5 terrain so you can drop unencumbered.</p>
</div>

### Class 3: Simple Climbing

You are using both hands to hang and hold onto the rock and climb up with your feet needing to find footholds to continue ascending. Novices may feel uncomfortable, but the holds are large and easy to locate. Class 3 is generally at above head height to a few body lengths going up passes, and is usually used to gain a new Class 2 ledge after one runs out or to gain the ridge itself. Your feet may be off the ground and supporting your weight as you climb for extended periods of time, and for those sensitive to heights there is mostly likely awareness of a fall. Class 3 is possible on low angle or flat slopes if there's vehicle to room sized talus on it that can't be bypassed.

<div class="callout alert">
  <p>Backpacker Note: It's “simple” climbing, but carrying a fully loaded pack up Class 3 can be VERY different from doing it unladen. The extra weight makes vertical moves more difficult - more critically your center of balance may be further away from the rock pulling you away from it and pack itself can become a physical obstacle if going up a crack or relatively tight space.  If using trekking poles, they'd generally be tucked away. It's not fun having one get stuck in a 15 foot crack halfway up it and having to downclimb and try and work it out while hanging onto rock.</p>

  <p>If you aren't experienced carrying a loaded pack up Class 3, it's highly recommended to travel with someone more experienced who can shuttle your pack up, explain and demonstrate the route, and if necessary wait at the top to grasp your wrist or stay at the bottom to spot you and or push your feet onto holds and call out moves. Trip leaders - it's on you to make sure novices make it safely up Class 3 with minimal risk and psychological damage.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout alert">
  <p>Climber Note: There is no limit to the height of such terrain, and exposure risk can be involved especially if bagging a peak or traversing a narrow ridge. If novices are along it can be a good idea to provide a rope and requisite gear to belay them if they feel uncomfortable.</p>
</div>

Secor's favorite description was given by Steve Roper: “Imagine climbing a steep, narrow staircase outside of a tall building without benefit of a railing: scary but easy.”

### Class 4: Climbing (rope recommended)

A noticeable step up from class 3 in terms of technique required. Class 4 is generally close to being vertical, with smaller holds and is likely exposed (though it can also be a short but more technical section that would fall under the PG modifier below). A classic example of unexposed Class 4 would be the wet steep walls that people downclimb on the southern side of Cirque Pass if they don't stay east of the pond below. Class 4 generally should not be done with a full pack for any considerable length, and many boots and shoes will start to fail to hold on the more subtle terrain. You'll generally want either more traditional boots with "structure" to the toe box or a lightweight shoe that conforms to the foot for better feel and independent use of foot muscles for control. Footwear with sloppy toe boxes that are comfortable on trail will likely slip off smaller holds. Rope is advised to be be in use though experienced individuals will often go without at their own risk.

Exposure risks aside, fit individuals with no climbing experience that have a good sense of balance, proper footwear, and aren't overly encumbered can generally make their way intuitively up short runs of Class 4 terrain. Expect overlap in the lower numbers of Class 5 (up to around 5.5) inside what's considered Class 4. If that doesn't make sense to you and you're interested in geeking out on technical details, this is [an epic rant on Class 4](https://www.summitpost.org/class-four-is-a-myth-problems-in-yds/891794). Class 4 is kind of a mess, but it's still a useful tool for describing terrain.

### Class 5: Technical Climbing (rope expected)

Class 5 been modified throughout the years as a living document so has been kept up to date. What most people visualize as Class 5 realistically starts around 5.5 or 5.6.

<div class="callout alert">
  <p>Backpacker note: Having some basic skill in Class 5 makes Class 2.5 and 3 much more manageable (you'll have some techniques and mental models for how to move that translate over) - it could be worth signing up for an introductory course at a local climbing gym if one is available.</p>

## Class 1-3 Terrain Modifiers

Terrain Modifiers - these are used to point out consequential aspects of the terrain itself (as opposed to how you move on it) that it could pose enough risk or discomfort to cause someone to turn around that are otherwise be comfortable moving on the class of terrain they are on. Occasionally wobbly talus or dirt that moves around a little bit is considered within the normal bounds of standard terrain. If there isn't a L,  S, or C it doesn't mean that everything is perfectly stable but there shouldn't be any meaningful impacts under normal conditions.

### L - Loose 

This is smaller talus, deep sand, gravel, scree, or duff which shifts when stepped on, but self-brakes (stops itself via friction) within a foot or so and will not cause a landslide. This terrain is generally much more pleasant to go down (boot ski) than up (slogging two steps up, then sliding one step down) but doesn't pose any major risk in and of itself.

### C - Collapsing

A more extreme version of loose terrain, where talus, scree, or gravel will go into a lengthy landslide that can either crash into or (partially)bury someone (Rodger Pass, Wallace Col, Clinch Pass, etc) or gravel that contains loosely enough held talus in it that can be dislodged (Junction Pass). 

Note that terrain which is normally stable can fatally collapse when saturated with early season snow melt, or during or immediately after heavy rain (a monsoon hitting SE Seki) due to mudslides or normally stable large talus being loose due to ground saturation. This is impossible to cover with a rating but is something to be aware of! Passes that traditionally held snow, but due to climate change are now often snow free in the summer can be particularly dangerous as it's likely there may not be enough sand/dirt/gravel around talus to anchor it in place.

### S - Skidding

Terrain which stays stable but on which your feet can skid off of. A common form of this terrain is sand or pebbles on top of otherwise hard packed dirt or slab, which is often explained as walking on ball bearings. Not seriously dangerous in and of itself if unexposed, but it can be very unnerving and uncomfortable to move on. Going up is generally preferred in order to have more control, while going down your momentum easily can lead to a fall. Poles can help with extra points of contact depending on the surface.

Examples of this would be the top of the path from Iceberg to Cecile lakes, the southern side of Potluck Pass, and Sky Pilot Pass. Overused trails can have areas like this - the JMT from Nevada Falls to Yosemite Valley comes to mind due to the amount of dirt tracked onto the old pavement. Skidding terrain which is also exposed (like King Col) should only be done with extreme caution.

### B - Bushbashing 

Bushes are at least waist high and there are no paths between them for at least 10 feet. Occasional bushes one has to brush by here or there, or areas of manzanita that have sandy paths weaving through them where you occasionally have to push through a few feet here and there and there don't qualify and are part of life.

## Class 1-4 Exposure Modifiers

Following the spirit of the Class 5 "movie rating" risk modifiers regarding the distance between aid placement, for unroped travel in Class 1-4 terrain they refer to the general risk associated with a fall due to [exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_%28heights%29). It's worth noting that you can sprain your ankle stumbling in a parking lot or crack your head open tripping on a sidewalk.

### G - Gentle

This is really only applicable to Class 1 terrain. Walking in an open forest, meadow, or gentle sandy slope would be G rated. 

### PG - Caution Advised

There's no big drops or significant risk of serious injury or death, but you could easily get banged up if you fall a short distance or lose your balance. Class 2 terrain is PG by default the vast majority of the time you could slide down a slope a bit and sprain a wrist or ankle, land awkwardly on talus you're moving across, etc.

Class 4 terrain is traditionally expected to be a long exposed approach to a peak but can still pose a significant obstacle to someone with a large pack on less than 10 feet high. Labeling these short sections "4 PG" indicates a more advanced mode of travel is required even if there isn't any real exposure.

### R - Exposed

While it'd be possible to walk away from an accident on this terrain it could easily result in moderate to serious injuries. This could be:

* A 15-20 foot drop within a foot of you. This will commonly be traversing narrow ledges or climbing small stretches of cliff face.
* A larger drop a couple of feet away that should be easily avoidable. This is a bit tricky as a fall would likely be fatal, but the exposure is indirect enough that it doesn't pose an imminent risk and is unlikely to happen without a perfect storm of errors.
* A steep slope of moderate length that isn't conducive to being able to easily stop once you start sliding down it.

People not overly sensitive to exposure may feel uncomfortable or unwilling to continue. This will likely be the most disputed risk/exposure modifier. :)

### X - Fatally Exposed

Sections with enough of an immediate drop that either a mistake in movement or a failure in terrain would most likely result in death or injury requiring evacuation. Even a 30 foot fall onto a hard surface is often fatal unless you can land in a controlled manner. 50-80 foot falls are generally fatal without extenuating circumstances.
